## About the Project
This is a pair project that was assigned 3 months into Turing School of Software and Design's 7-month front-end program. This project's aim was to learn how to use React, Router, and Cypress testing--this was our first time using these tools and concepts. This project was split where early iterations of the project used React without Router to build out all functionaity, then refactored to use Router. The learning goals of this project were: 

- Gain competency with React fundamentals
- Learn how to test React components & asynchronous JS
- Practice refactoring
- Create a multi-page UX using Router

### Technology stack
This project was built with:
- Javascript in React
- CSS
- Router
- Cypress
- GitHub Projects

## Getting Started
### Installation
1. Fork this Repo
1. Clone it down to your machine
1. cd into the root of the project directory
1. Run npm install
1. Run npm start and you will see a line similar to: `Project is running at http://localhost:3000/`
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to see the client side running
1. Enter ctrl + c anytime to stop either of the servers.

## Wins and Challenges

## Wins:
- Implemented React, Router, and Cypress for the first time in an application
- Successfully refactored original code with router to make it more browser friendly
- Logically thought through each user path for effective testing
- Gained an understanding of how efficient React is at building applications quickly

## Challenges:
- Implementing the synchronous sorting and searching functionality
- Reorganizing our app structure with Router (moving network requests and state to different components)
